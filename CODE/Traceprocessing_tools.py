## Pseudocode for Trace Processing Functionality

**Innovations**: The fracture processing system integrates morphological skeletonization, adaptive branch point handling, and geometric line simplification.

### Morphological preprocessing: 
1. **Image filtering**: Apply median filter and morphological thinning
2. **Topology analysis**: Detect branch points and endpoints using 8-neighborhood scanning

### Adaptive topology processing:  
3. **Branch assessment**: Evaluate extending segment characteristics
4. **Selective modification**: Apply conditional topology alterations using connectivity criteria

### Geometric simplification: 
5. **Path reconstruction**: Trace pixel sequences for each connected component
6. **Simplification**: Apply perpendicular distance test: d_perp = ||(p-s) Ã— (e-s)|| / ||e-s|| 
   - Where p = point, s = start, e = end of line segment

**Note**: The morphological operations follow established image processing principles. The DPM maintains geometric fidelity while reducing vertex count.
